            Many ML projects start with a metric and end with a dashboard. In
            between, we ship a model that does better on the metric and assume
            that must be good for the product. Sometimes that works. Sometimes
            the metric quietly fights the thing we actually care about.
          </p>
          <p>
            This note is about the second case: how to recognize misaligned
            metrics early, and a few simple patterns I use to keep evaluation
            and product goals in the same rough direction.
          </p>

          <h2 id="start-from-the-decision">Start from the decision, not the model</h2>
          <p>
            A useful question to ask at the beginning of any project is: <em>
              what decision changes if this model is good?
            </em>
            If you can't answer that clearly, you're probably at risk of
            optimizing the wrong thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the decision is clear, work backwards: what offline metric is
            a reasonable stand&#8209;in for that decision? What are the obvious ways
            it could fail? What guardrail metrics would catch those failures
            before users do?
          </p>

          <h2 id="guardrails-as-first-class">Guardrails as first&#8209;class citizens</h2>
          <p>
            It's common to treat guardrails as an afterthought: we'll add them
            to the dashboard later, once we know the main metric is moving. In
            practice, I've found it more reliable to treat guardrails as
            co-equal with the primary metric from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you're optimizing click&#8209;through, you might care
            just as much about long&#8209;term engagement, complaint rates, or some
            measure of perceived quality. Put those metrics in the same table as
            your primary win metric; they're part of the story, not a footnote.
          </p>

          <h2 id="tell-the-story">Tell the story in plain language</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, make sure someone can explain the evaluation story without
            looking at a single chart. What changed, for whom, and how sure are
            we? If that story sounds off, the metric probably is too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal isn't a perfect metric. It's a metric that is honest about
            what it captures, and a team that can recognize when the metric and
            the product are starting to pull in different directions.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you'd like a deeper dive into this topic, I'm always happy to
            walk through real examples (wins and failures) in more detail.
