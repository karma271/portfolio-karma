            Most teams don't suffer from a lack of experiments; they suffer from
            experiments that are hard to interpret. Weeks of work lead to a
            slide that says "looks promising, but we're not sure".
          </p>
          <p>
            This note collects a few patterns I've found helpful when designing
            experiments that lead to decisions instead of debates.
          </p>

          <h2 id="write-the-decision-memo">Write the decision memo first</h2>
          <p>
            Before launching, write a short paragraph that future you could paste
            into a decision memo: what you'll do if the experiment wins, loses,
            or is inconclusive. If you can't fill that in, something about the
            design or the metric probably needs more work.
          </p>

          <h2 id="guardrails-and-pre-registration">Guardrails and pre-registration</h2>
          <p>
            Pre-registration doesn't need to be heavy. A simple checklist of
            primary metric, guardrails, sample size, and stopping rules is often
            enough to avoid the worst garden-of-forking-paths problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treat guardrails as part of the success criteria: "we'll ship if the
            primary metric improves by X and complaint rate, churn, and latency
            stay within these bands".
          </p>

          <h2 id="make-trade-offs-explicit">Make trade-offs explicit</h2>
          <p>
            In real products, you rarely get a free lunch. A good experiment
            write-up should call out the expected trade-offs in plain language:
            who might be worse off, and by how much, even if the primary metric
            improves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal isn't a perfect experiment. It's a design that lets your
            team make a clear, honest decision with the data you have.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm always interested in better ways to bring causal thinking into
            day-to-day product work. If you have war stories or questions here,
            I'd love to hear them.
          </p>
